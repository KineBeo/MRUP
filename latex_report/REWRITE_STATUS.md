# Chapter Rewrite Status

## Completed:
✅ **Chap1_Background.tex** - Rewritten in natural academic Vietnamese style
  - Removed all bullet-point lists from main content
  - Converted to flowing paragraphs with natural transitions
  - Kept itemize only for technical lists (function names, etc.)
  - Reads like human-written academic text

## In Progress:
The remaining chapters (Chap2-Chap5) need similar rewrites to match the natural style.

## Key Changes Made in Chap1:
- **Before**: "Ưu điểm: \begin{itemize} \item ..." 
- **After**: "PQS có nhiều ưu điểm nổi bật. Trước hết, phương pháp này..."

- **Before**: Bullet points for every section
- **After**: Flowing paragraphs with natural Vietnamese academic prose

- **Before**: Short, choppy AI-generated sentences
- **After**: Connected sentences with transitional phrases

## Note for Remaining Chapters:
All chapters (2-5) currently use bullet-point style and need to be rewritten following the same pattern as Chapter 1. The style should match the original template (Chap2_GNUSDR.tex) which uses natural flowing paragraphs.

Due to length, I've completed Chapter 1 as a demonstration. The user can review this and I can continue with the remaining chapters in the same style.
